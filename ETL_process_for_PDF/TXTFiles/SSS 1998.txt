AFAI08: fast ferry first for China
With a fully laden trial speed of 48.2
knots. Afiri OS is Lhe first high-speed
passenger/car ferry to be constructed in
China and certainly rates amongst the
fastest Asian-built commercial craft. Built
at Afiai Southern Shipyard (Panyu), the
vessel is the first in the K50 Class.
developed us a joint venture by Australian
yard [neat Tasmania, Alai Ships of Hong
Kong and Advanced Multi-Hull Designs
(AMD), also of Australia.
Designed to carry 450 passengers and
S9 ears, the K50 exceeds the quality
standards established hy international
classification societies and strong claims
arc made for its economy. Use of four
medium speed Ruston I6RK 270 diesel
engines, of around 5.500kW each, keep
running costs low and reliability high. Two
K series vessels operating worldwide, built
by Encat Australia, have reportedly proven
extremely reliable since operation started
in 1995.
Ajiii 08 has two slender 5m alloy hulls.
measuring 72.3m on the water!inc.
supporting an alloy superstructure on anti-
vibration mounts. Each has eight vented,
watertight sub-divisions comprising lore
peak, two voids, pump compartment,
engine room and waterjet space. All
compartments are divided by transverse
bulkheads.
Each hull is fitted with two Kamewa 80
Sll vvalerjet units. All jets are configured
for steering and reversing and have ;i
separate hydraulic system in each hull,
together with two electric motors driving
separate pumps.
The K50 is designed for the stern
loading of cars on the main deck and has
space on the aft deck for carrying larger
heavy loads such as buses or freight. Duty-
free shopping and passenger amenities are
centrally located on the main deck, with
the second deck devoted to seating for up
lo 450 passengers. A liil is installed for
disabled passengers.
The wheelhouse. on the tipper deck just
alt of amidships, is accessed by stairs from
the passenger area or externally via a rear
door. Offering 360-degree visibility to
enhance safety of manoeuvring operations,
all-round windows have demisters and
independently operated and controlled
Wynn straight line and pantograph wipers.
The ihree forward central windows have
solar blinds. Forward facing seats are filtei!
around a centreline navigation console but
the main helmsman sits at the forward era!
of the wheelhouse. just off centreline to
starboard.
Navigation equipment is extensive and
includes: Magnuvox MX DGPS. Kelvin
Hughes radars. Skipper DGSIOI echo
sounder. Walker speed/distance log and
wind speed/direction finder, C-P!ath
autopilot, gyro compass and magnetic
compass. Onboard communications
systems for machinery, mooring and
passenger spaces are controlled from the
wheel house.
A comfortable ride is ensured by the
installation of a Maritime Dynamics active
ride control system with hydraulically
operated trim tabs hinged at the after end
of each hull. Each hull aiso has a special
abutment to lake optional, forward bolt-
on T-foils and is fitted with an emergency
trim tab lifting device, which is activated
in the event of complete hydraulic Failure.

AMBULU: first
of five for Asia
AmimVu, the first-of-class FPF 62-
010 from German megayacht builder
Lursscn Wcrfl. is the first of five such
ferries ordered by Indonesian operator
ASDP.
Constructed in lightweight aluminium,
shaped for minimal air resistance and
propelled by four giant waterjets, the
design owes much to the aircraft industry.
Similarities also exist internally with
'class' based passenger categories and
forward facing seats.
The ship's lines owe much (o extensive
and systematic research, model and
seakeeping tank tests which were carried
out in the Hamburg ship model basin
(HSVA). The lines were optimised with
various test models of different sizes.
resulting in course stability with excellent
seakeeping and low resistance.
The selected hull type is a deep-vee
monohull with a parallel wedge shaped
stern and sprayrail. At a Froude number
of 0.79. the semi-displacement ship can
maintain its high speed and stability up to
moderate wave heights and at reduced
speed, good behaviour is reported owing
to a Vosper Thoniycrofl active stabiliser
system.
To meet the new IMC) Code for High
Speed Craft. Ambulu has two separate
engine compartments each serving one
steerable water jet and one booster jet.
Power for the Kamewa jets is supplied by
four MTU type 16V595 TIE 70L diese!
engines, developing 3805kW at 1,825 rev/
mill.
Improved docking, easy maintenance
and collision avoidance measures have
been given special consideration, A bow
thruster has been incorporated to aid
manoeuvrability and engine and ventilation
casings arranged to enable unit
replacement within a 24-hour time span.
As Ihe FPF's area of operation is
frequented by fleets of fishing vessels,
Collision avoidance by means ol a short

CB 1 &CB 2: sister cats on
standby airport rescue
After a nine-month build period, two
catamaran rescue command vessels
CB I and CB 2 were handed over to the
Hong Kong Airport Authority in April '98
by builder. Greenbay Marine of Singapore.
Each is ready for deployment from special
rescue berths at either end of (be new Click
Lap Kok Airport.
The vessels arc based on an [neat hull
with major modifications above the
walcrline made by Vancouver-based naval
architect, Robert Allan to suit (heir fire-
lighting, search and rescue roles.
Measuring 35.30m x 12.00m. the
catamarans have a maximum speed of 28
knots and are designed to withstand 60-
knot winds and five-metre waves and to
operate in shallow water.
The extensive array of rescue and fire-
righting systems aboard each vessel
necessitated an intensive familiarisation
programme for crews, each of nine men.
who will man the craft. Equipment
includes two RIBs. life raits with a carrying
capacity of 300 persons, four inflatable
rescue ramps, hydraulic cranes and lift
platforms, four Jason's Cradles, specialisl
detection items such as sonar, thermal
imaging and underwater cameras and two
Skum FJM tlre-fighting monitors. Capable
of discharging 4.000 [itres/min, the
monitors are mounted on diametrically
opposite corners of the main deck.
Floodlights to illuminate the rescue zone
are carried at the head ofa telescopic mast.
Power is provided by two MTU I2V
39d TB74L diesels. each developing
l,455kW at 2,000 rev/min, driving
Kamevva 71SII waterjets via ZF BW465
gearboxes. A pair of l55kW Caterpillar
3306B driven generator sets supplies the
electrical power.
Each boat lias a rescue capacity of 600
people with onboard accommodation for
up lo 300 and sufficient inflatable rafts
to hold 300 more. In excess of 240
survivors and a minimum of 40
stretchers can be housed in the cabin on
main deck and five patients tended in
the separate hospital all. It is not the
intention lo station doctors on the vessel
bul the crews have been trained in first
aid and. if necessary, the helicopter
winching platform could be used lo bring
medical teams aboard.
At the commissioning ceremony The
Airport Aulhorily (AA) chairman. Wong
Pu-yan. commented: "The airport is
designed and buill to operate to the
highest standards of safety. With these
boats we are now much belter equipped
to conduct rescue and fire-fighting
operations on the sea surrounding the
airport island. Our safety, of course, is
guaranteed also by placing these well-
designed vessels in the capable hands
of the highly professional crew from the
Airport Fire Services."
Raymond Ton, managing director of
Gree ubay M ari ne, w h i eh won an
international tender from the Hong Kong
Marine Department to build the vessels,
said modern communications played a
key role in the shipbuilding project. "In
view of the lime constraints and crucial
performance requirements, without
modern information and
communications, success would not have
been possible. Extensive and precise
cross-country project management was
needed to achieve optimal design."

ADVENTURER:
trophy-winning trimaran
Anew entrant in die record hooks for
'98 was the dramatically styled 35m
\ 14.10m trimaran, Cable & Wireless
Adventurer. Designed hy UK based naval
architect Nigel hens, the vessel
circumnavigated the globe in 74 days. 20
hours and 58 minutes, stealing the record
from the nuclear submarine USS Triton,
which finished iis journey on the 84"' day
back in I960.
Adventurer's 26.000 mile voyage began
and ended in Gibraltar and was the first
attempt to elaim a new trophy funded by
Cable & Wireless and awarded by the UIM
(the governing body of power boating) for
Ihe fastest time around the world. The
trimaran took a mainly equatorial route,
with stopovers at Monte Carlo. Port Said.
Singapore. Hong Kong. Yokohama. San
Diego, Kingston. Miami and New York.
Constructed in lightweight wood epo\y
and FRP composite, the record-breaking
design has a slender central hull and small
outer hulls for transverse stability.
Important aspects of the design included
displacement/length ratio of the main hulls
and the position, dimensions and geometry
of the other hulls. A high level ot'
redundancy for systems and machinery was
included lo ensure that the vessel could
continue in operation in all but the most
severe systems' failures.
Power is supplied by twin Cummins
6CTA8.3M diesel engines, each
developing 261 kW ;tt 2,500 rev/min. These
drive Teiguhiidge 26-inch I'our-bladed
propellers via Twin Disc MG-5I11SC
gearboxes for a maximum speed of 22
knots. Fuel capacity is 15,700 litres, giving
the vessel a range of 2.3(X)um. To protect
the stern gear, propellers are positioned
under the central hull and filled with full
skegs. Scawaler-eooled charge air coolers.
manufactured by Serck Heal Transfer, in
marine-compatible materials, were
incorporated lo reduce the temperature of
the charge air as it enters the engine's
induction system. This increased the mass
and density of the air, improving
combustion and thereby raising power
output and reducing emission levels.
Accommodation for a crew of 16 is
situated on the main deck with eighl two-
berth cabins, captain's cabin. VIP cabin
and mess. A central stairway gives access
to ihe horseshoe shaped low-profile bridge
and the flybridge. Onboard navigational
equipment has been supplied largely by
Raytheon and includes two radars.
Inmarsat VI and C and gyro compass. A
McLennan Vislar night vision system is
also fitted.

CATLINK V: trans-Atlantic
record breaker
In July 1998 Catlink V, the second of
two 91 in wave piercing catamarans built
by [neat Australia, entered the record books
as the current holder of the Blue Riband
and Hales Trophy for the fastest trans-
Allantic crossing.
Catlbtk V broke the two world records
set just a month earlier by another [neat
ship Catalonia and clocked an average
voyage speed of 40.28 knots, marginally
lower than its proven 43-knot service
speed.
Along with sister terry Cat/ink IV, the
record-holder was ordered by Seandlines
Cat-Link A/S oi' Denmark to replace three
fas! femes previously servicing the route
between Arlms and Kalundhorg. Carrying
up to 800 passengers and 220 cars, each
vessel completes the 42nm crossing in
around 75 minutes and. fo further save
time, has been fitted with a special loading
arrangement. This comprises the
traditional stem access, together witii a
forward door on the porf side allowing all
220 cars lo be unloaded in around eight
minutes.
Although larger in size, the vessel design
has evolved from a number of successful
Incat car ferries, especially those in the
74m to K6m range. Both Cat-Link vessels
were built at the Incal shipyard in Mobart.
Tasmania to the requirements of DNV
High Speed Light Craft Rules (classed
+ 1AI HSLC Rl Car Ferry "A" EO) and
the IMO High Speed Craft Code.
Attention has been paid not only to
enhanced loading systems but also to
extensive fire prevention and extinguishing
systems, enhanced ride characteristics and
fuel economy.
Catlink V is conventionally powered by
four Ruston 20 RK270 medium speed
diesels. each developing 7.080k\V
(9.500hp), driving Lips waterjels through
Renk reduction gearboxes. A custom
designed Lipstronic jet control system
provides, apart from steering and reversing,
the option of thrust vectoring and autopilot
control. According to Incal, at full
displacement with speeds of about 35
knots, fuel savings of 25 per cent can be
achieved.
Two 230k\V Caterpillar generators in
each hull feed associated independent
main switchboards, which are capable
Significant Small Craft of 1998 13
of disconnection in an emergency. Built-
in redundancy provides a high level of
security Tor operation of safely services.
In the event of the loss of one machinery
space or switchboard a bus lie can be
nipped to provide complete isolation of
the main switchboard or to ensure the
machinery space on the opposite side is
unaffected.
Comfort has been addressed by
installation of a Maritime Dynamics ride
control system, now installed on a total of
24 [ncal car ferries. Comprising an active
trim tab mounted at the transom of each
hull lo provide trim and motion
dampening, it can be used lo adjust the
gain on pilch, roll ami heave motions
to optimise vessel performance to suit
sea conditions, wave direction and
speed.
Ride has also been improved by
increasing the waierlinc Jenglh of the
fecry by approximately 34 percent over
the Ineal 74m vessels of the early
1990s, thus ensuring a more
comfortable ride.
Advanced lightweight fire
protection fittings, developed by
Colbeck & Gunlon of Tasmania, have
been used throughout. These include
single-leafed hinged fire doors,
single and double sliding tire doors,
guillotine fire dampers, engine room
fire dampers, fire hatches and smoke
baffles. A Thorn Solid State Fire
Detection system which monitors a
combination of smoke, break glass
and heat detectors has also been
installed.
Evacuation systems, supplied by
Liferal't Syslems Australia, cater for
900 people and comprise four slides
and a series of lifcrafts.
Catlink V has one further notable
feature: an uncluttered wheelhouse.
Despite central and wing control
positions to aid docking manoeuvres,
space is maximised as many electronic
devices arc separately housed in an air-
conditioned electronics room, which is
accessed via a private stairwell leading from
the bridge or vehicle deck.

Operator of the same name represented a
major export coup for Chilean yard Asenav
as the first vessel it has ever built for a
European country.
Ordered to fish for pelagic species in
the North Sea and North Atlantic, the
vessel is almost identical to El Cazador
built by Asenav in September '97 for a
Chilean company, bin has increased power
and hold capacity.
Norwegian designer Vik Sandvik has
created a round bilge hull form with a U-
lype transom and bulbous bow. The ship
lias tip profile frames, a double bottom and
an aluminium wheelhouse.
With accommodation for 20. the trawler
has two continuous decks as well as

FAR SENIOR: refined
and powerful
All four Ulstein UT 722 vessels bought
by Norwegian operator Farsiad
Shipping over the pasl five years have
progressively benefited from extra
refinements and modifications, The fifth
to join the licet. Far Senior, proves to be
no exception.
Constructed by Langslen Slip &
Batbyggeri, the anchor-hand I ing lug supply
vessel has an impressive array of lowing
and anchor-handling equipment and a 189-
tonne continuous bollard pull. Most
intriguing amongst its machinery, however,
is a retractable hydraulic crane, which folds
into the deck on the starboard side aft. The
purpose of the crane, which has a
horizontal pull of six tonnes, is to handle
the increasingly heavy connections and
shackles in Ihe Kami Fork area, h is
probably the first lime a crane of this type
lias been used aboard an AHTS. Capable
of full remote control by the deck crew,
the crane is expected lo offer a greater level
of safety and ease of working.
Traditional equipment is less innovative
but nonetheless formidable. Main anchor-
handling and lowing winches have a
maximum brake holding capacity of 550
tonnes, with a line pull of 400 tonnes at
Mm/miu. The capacity of each winch drum
is 6,300m of 76mm diameter SWR or
4,600m of 90mm diameter SWR, The main
low wire - 1,300m of 83mm SWR - can be
readily removed and stowed on a powered
reel lo enable the full capacity of both
winch drums to be used. Two lugger
winches each have a 20-lonne line pull and
house 600m of 76mm SWR.
Four Karm towing pins, with a safe
working load of 240 tonnes, are installed
forward of the stem roller, with two Kami
forks rated at 650 tonnes.
Far Senior is powered by four Ulsiein
Bergen diesels producing a total of
16,800hp. These drive two controllable
pilch propellers, rotating in fixed nozzles.
Twn shaft generators of 2.800kVA each are
coupled lo the main propulsion twin inpul/
single output gearboxes and a pair of
Ulstein high lifi rudders and a l.200hp
transverse stern thrusler are installed. A
similar transverse ihrusler is Titled in the
bow in addition to a retractable fully
a/.imuthing ihrusler powered by a separate
[,200bhp engine.
Whilst the maximum bollard pull is, as
stated, 189 tonnes, a pull of around 165
tonnes is achievable with all tbrusiers
operating at SO per cent capacity. The
vessel has a maximum speed of 17 knots
and an economical cruising speed of 12
knots.
In addition to Us powerful machinery.
Far Senior has a deck cargo area of 585m3
with a maximum load of 900 tonnes,
internal tanks for liquid storage and a dry
bulk cargo area of 10.000ft \ High capacity
discharge systems are provided for all dry
bulk and liquid cargoes. Four integral chain
lockers, located amidships, have a total
capacity of 546m3 of ri» mooring chain.
The wheclhouse features an array of
navigational and communications
equipment including an Anscbutz Pilolslar
D autopilot, two Furuno radars, luiruiio
FE680 echosounder, Seaiex/Fumno DO PS
and an HCD1S chart system.

sandwich construction, are located in-line
astern and can easily be replaced by
containers of freight. The modules arc
mounted on vibration absorbing supports
behind the futuristic bridge/bow section
and can accommodate 240 passengers.
Principal criteria behind the
development of the new style catamaran
were seaworthiness, low wake and high
performance and a variety of configurations
were tested by ihe builder back in 1995 ai
the Matin facility in Holland to ascertain
the optimum solutions. Tank testing was
carried out in '96 on l/10'h scale models
and the first-of-class launched in
November 1997.
The result has striking lines and a higher
than average built-in safely factor,
according to the company. The concept of
'containerising' the passenger spaces away
from machinery and fuel storage areas is a
big safety bonus, further augmented by the
extensive use of non-combusiible coatings
and flame-proof partitions, panelling and
floor coverings.

As an alternative to the 6.1, Iris
Catamarans offers the 6.2, an enhanced
version able to carry 398 passengers on
(he same basic size and hull configuration
by the simple expedient of a double layer
of passenger modules. Using I he 16V
version of the MTU engines, a slightly
increased service speed is forecast and the
maximum speed is expected lo be
improved by a little over four knots. The
bigger version has a larger bow pod to
allow rearward visibility from the bridge,

JADE EXPRESS:
testing the Caribbean market
With a speed of 40 knots and capacity
Tor ten cars and 330 passengers.
Austat's first mid size Fast ferry in the
proven Auto Express range of vehicle-
passenger catamarans, entered service in
the French Caribbean in April/May '98.
Delivered to L'Express des lies - the
fast ferry operation of French Maritime
Group. Compagnie Chambon, the 48m
ship was seen as an economical menus
to test market demand for car carrying,
with minimal sacrifice to passenger
capacity. In addition, as it is built to HSC
Code, the vehicle deck can also be
utilised For cargo carrying.
As a 30-miiuiie turnaround in port was
specified, the car deck has been specially
designed For swift loading and
unloading. Cars enter and exit the vessel
via a hydraulic-ally operated 3m port side
ramp located all on the main deck. This
system allows the vessels to berth ill
existing facilities on the island of
Martinique with only simple shore based
ramps required to reach die height ol' the
car deck. Vehicle deck height is 2.1m
and structural fire protection and
drencher systems Feature throughout.
Forward of the ten parking bays is an
18m: area designated For baggage and
cargo space.
Jade Express is fitted with four MTU
16V 396TFJ4L engines and the Austal
Ocean Leveller ride control system,
which features T-foils forward and
interceptors all on the transom of each
hull. With a trial deadweight of 49
tonnes, the vessel achieved a maximum
speed of 40 knots and a service speed
(90 per cent MCR) of 38 knots.
Although operating with two bridge
crew, four helm chairs are installed in
Ihe well-equipped wheelliouse. The
bridge features external wing stations
wilh Kamcwa controls for precise
manoeuvring and docking. Olher

MKL2201: fast RIB
fashioned for Finland
In the early 1980s UK boalbuilder Delta
Marine Services introduced the first of
an entirely new range of rigid inflatable
boat. Featuring a high bow sheer, constant
deep V hull and broad beam, the design
found ready acceptance with rescue, police,
patrol and diving authorities around the
world. In 198-1.approval was received from
the UK Department of Transport (DTpl
for fast rescue craft use in the North Sea
oilfields, thus setting even stricter
manufacturing standards.
A highlight for 1997/98 was completion
of an 11.5m fast daughter craft RIB for the
Finnish Southwestern Maritime District.
Although based on the II? or Super X
Delta range, which is around 60cm wider
than the 5-5rn-6.5ni Delta Dash range of
rescue boats, MKL 2201 was closely
tailored to the authority's specific needs.
Powered by a single 3406E 7000hp
commercially rated Caterpillar diesel
driving a Kamewa FF375S waterjet via a
Twin Disc type MG5114A gearbox, the
craft achieved a speed in excess of 45
knots.
High speed was a particular requirement
for the broad range of duties and extensive
geographical operating area assigned to the
vessel. Ordered in an administrative
capacity for fast patrol and pilot duties in
the provinces of Turku, Pori and Aland,
its nntlti-role capabilities are put to the test
in helping to promote good navigation and
safeguard shipping in a
particularly busy stretch of
water. The district includes
over 3.800km of marked
fairways and approximately
5.000 aids to navigation with
five pilot stations and an
international radio station.
Around 7.500 acts of pilotage
occur annually covering
400,000km. The authority is
also responsible for vessel
surveys and inspections and
the upkeep and development of
regularly scheduled
archipelago traffic.
Comfort was deemed as
important as speed. A fully
enclosed aluminium
wliculhoLise. derived from die
proven 95 daughter craft series in offshore
operation but shortened to suit the
authority's needs, is fitted with six KAB
seats, galley and toilet. The interior has
been laid out for best ergonomics with the

NEUWERK: marine
disaster prevention in the
North sea
Equipped for i! number of roles but
With strong emphasis on that of iruiri ne
pollution control, 78.91m x 18.63m
Neuwerk is now in operalion from its home
port of Cuxhavcn, servicing the North Sea.
Described as 'a marine disaster
prevention ship'. Neuwerk was planned,
designed, specified and supervised in build
by the Watcrerat'l Department of
Germany's Federal Waterways
Engineering & Research Institute (BAW)
and built by the German yard of Volkswerft
Stralsund. The lines of the .ship are based
<in conventional designs optimised by the
Hamburg Ship Model Basin.
Reinforced to comply with GL Ice Class
E3, the hull has a stem which tails off
beneath the vessel into a box-shaped keel.
This, together with two keel elements
above the propellers, improves ice-
breaking action and helps clear broken ice
away from the propellers. The hull is
divided into seven watertight
compartments by vertical bulkheads and
contains stainless steel cargo tanks, which
are positioned lengthways and completely
isolated from the sides and bottom by
cofferdams. There are four in-hull decks
and four superstructure decks plus a
helicopter winch deck aft.
Power is provided by four main diesel
generator units working in parallel. To
allow the power generated to match
demand and thus avoid the low-load
problems associated with diesel engines,
three MTU 16V 595 TC50 units, each
developing 3,00UkW at 1,500 rev/min and
one MTU I2V 396 TC54 developing
96()kW, at the same speed, are installed
side-by-side, just forward of amidships. A
pair of 2,900kW Schottel Rudder-
propellers with FP propellers, inside
nozzles, is fitted at the stern and a 2.6()0k\V
Schottel pump-jet at the bow. On trials,
the vessel achieved a bollard pull of 113.5
tonnes and speed of 14.9 knots. A fourth
generator set of 300kW is provided for
harbour use.
Wilh built-in skimming devices and a
citadel-type interior to protect against toxic
or explosive external atmospheres, the
main role of Neuwerk is undoubtedly
marine pollution control.
The gas protection system
extends to all interior
living and working areas
including bridge, crew
quarters and engine
rooms. Entrance and exit
to and from 'the citadel'
is via gas locks and the
interior is supplied with
decontaminated air.
purified through modular
filter stations, each fitted
with sub-micron and
activated carbon fillers.
Pressure is maintained
above outside atmospheric pressure to
prevent the possibility of polluted air
entering the citadel and constant
monitoring and failsafe systems arc in
place. The engines are cooled by a closed
circuit freshwater system to avoid the risk
of contamination.
Neuwerk is equipped with a pair of
built-in independent sweeping arm
skimmers for oil spill duties. Developed
by Jastram Forseluing of Hamburg, each
measures 15m in length and can be
deployed at angles of 35 to 65 degrees
to the ship's side whilst the vessel
proceeds at under 2.5 knots. Floating

substances.
Other roles for (lie vessel include
emergency lowing, buoy lending, fire-
fighting, ice-breaking and policing. For
ETV operations the ship is equipped
with a Hatlapa lowing winch of 2,000kN
brake holding power with 1,000m of
towrope. Two tugger winches and
retractable towing pins are also fitted
and a CCTV system enables all lowing
equipment to be bridge controlled
although the NMF deck crane shields
some of Ihc view. The crane, with
telescopic jib, is for buoy handling and
salvaging cargo lost overboard by
casualties. A retractable sonar, installed
at ihe base of the foreship,
can he used In locale sunken
objects.
For fire-fighting operations,
two monitors are carried, each
with a range of 120ni and a
throwing height of 45m. One
monitor is mounted on a
telescopic mast, which can be
raised liydraulically to a point
35m above the waterline. In
addition, two 370m'' water/
foam monitors and a
].480m7h sprinkler system
arc installed. The latter system
can also be used for decontamination
purposes during gas protected operation.
Remotely controlled from within the

NEW /WE/?: radical
docking module
A radically different alternative to the
traditional berthing tug started work
early in '9S with owners Hvide Marine in
Port Everglades, Florida. New River, a 90ft
x 50ft Ship Docking Module (SDM). built
at Halter's Lockport yard, has impressive
manoeuvrability and the ability to generate
a very high proportion of its power in any
direction - forward, backwards or
sideways.
The brainchild of Eric Hvide and
designed in detail by Seattle based Elliott
Bay Design Group, the vessel has two
Ulstein model I65QH fixed pilch Z-Drives
mounted forward and aft and diagonally
offset some 2m from the centre-line of the
hull. Caterpillar 3516BTA engines,
developing 2,000hp at 1.600 rev/min. are
positioned at each end of the vessel, leaving
ample space in the engine room for two
75kW Delroil Diesel 4-71 generator sets.
Although later vessels in the series have
internal ladder arrangements to the
whcelhouse. New River - designed for
operation in a warm climate by a two-man
crew - has exterior bridge access with
cabins opening directly onto the aft deck.
Visibility from the bridge is excellent via
halt' height windows forward and lull
height windows aft. Two island consoles,
each with main engine and thruster control,
are positioned at the forward end.
As New River manoeuvres in all
directions, the entire 'circumference' of
its Hat bottomed hull has been protected
by Schiiyler cut-tyre fendering. It has
also been equipped with a unique extra
type of protection, although in this
instance for ecological reasons - manatee

Deck machinery comprises a Markcy
DYSF-39 hawser winch with capacity for
500ft of soflline. This is fitted with a 30hp
hydraulic power unil. hydraulic drum
brake, an instrumentation system for
monitoring tension and single station
pilothouse controls. A remotely operated
3.000 galis/rnin Skum fire monitor is
mounted on lop of the wheelhouse.
Although the SDM was ABS approved
at lOV.OOOlbs pull, peaks of around
ll4,000lbs were achieved when the
vessel entered service. Slight problems
were, however, caused with the
diagonally opposed and offset thruslcrs
creating a slight lift as water Hows across
each adjacent skeg. This elTecl is
doubled as the bow tends lo go one way
and the stern the other. In open water on
a long warp, as required for the bollard
pull lest, this is sufficient to cause the
vessel to turn off-line which the
helmsman naturally corrects by adjusting
the angle of the Ihruslers. This reduces
the achievable test bollard pull.
Slots have been incorporated in the
skegs of the subsequent deliveries 5/ Johns

PORTUNUS: first
of three for ABP
A new lypc of pilot vessel, developed
xVby naval architect David Cannell and
built by Southampton-based yard
Halinaiic. entered service in the Associated
British Port (ABP) fleet last year. Lead
vessel Portunus, the first of ihrec craft to
be ordered as a modern alternative to
ABP's traditional favourite - the l-lalmntie
Nelson - offers higher speeds and a drier
ride.
ABP's need to upgrade arose in pan
because of changes in pilot boal
regulations, which had increased the
displacement of the Nelsons leading to a
'wet' ride with excess spray on windscreen
and deck. The new generation solution,
based on an PRCV (Fast Round Chine
Vessel) hull form offered an ideal
alternative.
The FRCV incorporates a single chine
nf optimum angle for lift and dryness. well
rounded topsides above the chine aft,
warped bottom and reduced deadrise
towards the transom. According to the
designer, the hull oilers seakeeping with
even lower acceleration forces than a semi-
displacement hull form of lower speed
range.
"To achieve this, the hull shape has been
developed with very line entry for excellent
head sea performance, maintaining the
centre of lalcral urea of the hull well aft,
to give superb down sen performance."
says Cannell, To maintain u dry foredeck
in heavier seas, a high reserve of buoyancy
is incorporated into the forward sections
above the chine.
The performance is further enhanced by
highly de\e!oped tunnelling to the
propellers, which results in lower draft.
less keel depth and reduced power
requirements.
Built in accordance with the MSA Code
of Practice for Workboals & Pilot Boats.
Portunus (named for the Roman god of
harbours) operates within ABP's
Compulsory Pilotage Area - a 2S-mile
stretch of water from Southampton to the
Nab Channel. Like the third in the series,
Portuniis has sealing for coxswain,
crewman and six pilots. The second vessel.
Prospect, has been designed for a
combined patrol/pilotage/VIP carrying role
and seats six with a full si?.c chart table.
A lop speed of 26 knots - six knots faster
than the Nelson average - is derived from
two V-drive mounted Scania DS1 14 diesel
engines, developing 52Ohp at 1800 rev/
tain. These drive two four-bladed
propellers via a Twin Disc MG51I4RV

38 Signihcam Small Craft of
RPC1150:
pilot/patrol craft with
competitive streak
Versatility and competitive pricing
were key require incuts set out by
French yard Raidco Marine Inlernaiional
when commissioning UK based naval
architect Alastair Cameron to design a
pilot/patrol vessel for its commercial cral'l
portfolio. The first-of-class vessel,
purchased by West African owners, boasts
innovative features and was fully
customised at minimal extra cost.
Developed from a range of proven
Camarc multi-chine hull designs, the GRP
boat has a deep V huli which enables it to
maintain speed in adverse conditions
whilst remaining stable at slower speeds.
A major extra feature is an all-round
reinforced PU/foam fender system,
developed by Raidco for maximum
protection. The system is modular,
enabling damaged sections to be swiftly
repaired when necessary and creates an
easier, safer boarding platform for pilots
and Other personnel.
A simple internal layout can easily be
amended to suit customer requirements
and a number of superstructure options are
also offered. For the first vessel a steeply
raked whcclhouse was selected with
seating for six pilots or crew plus a
helmsman and navigator. A small cabin.
WC and galley is incorporated forward.
The iowerdeek level comprises a small
forepcak area divided by a watertight
bulkhead from the forward void space/store
and fuel lank space aft.
The hull can accommodate twin
propulsion units if required and outdrive
or conventional propeller installations are
available. The West African owners opted
for a single Cummins 6CTA 400hp diesel
engine driving a Hamilton 291 waterjet -
a package which is reported to give a 2K
knot cruising speed and exceptional fuel
economy. With twin engine options the
vessel should achieve speeds of up to 40
knots.
Raidco is marketing the design for
international authorities seeking a capable
and cost-effective craft for coastal and
harbour operations. Delivery of !he first
vessel led to yet another contract from West
Africa. Application this time, fora smaller
10m long version, is fisheries protection
and three open console vessels were
selected. Each benefits from (lie special
foam fender arrangement and has single
diesels driving waterjets.

RAM 24: tough RIB on
proven hull form
Aluminium hoat builders. SeaArk
Marine of Arkansas, USA, extended
iis portfolio in early "98 with the
introduction of a rigid inflatable patrol
boat Designated [he Ram Class, the new
concept combines proven hulls from the
Commander and Dauntless classes with a
specially designed heavy-duty Lube system
which can be air or foam filled.
Deep 21 degree V hulls, developed live
years ago by C Raymond Hunt &
Associates, have been selected for their
performance in rough seas. The following
advantages are cited; smooth ride in choppy
waters because of a sharp 45 degree bow
entry; dry ride due to multiple lift strakes.
wide chines and highly flared bows; and
excellent stability, both al rest and
underway, caused by wide chines afl and
wide waterline beams. In following or
quartering seas. Hunt hulls are said to have
less tendency to yaw or become buried in
steep sea conditions.
The Ram collar enhances performance
in surf or Whitewater conditions by
providing considerable levels of extra
buoyancy. In high banking turns, the collar
contacts the water, reducing roll, and
stability is enhanced when large numbers
of people are working over the side.
Attached to the hull by means of a boll
rope system on a continuously welded
track, the collar is mounted
approximately six inches above the load
waterline. A number of advantages arc
claimed over conventional RIBs where
tubes are frequently partially submerged:
marine growth on the tube surfaces is
eliminated; the hullfurm. with its wide
chines, is more efficient al higher speeds
because tubes are noi dragged through
the water; the collar is "D" shaped,
providing greater interior working room,
working side decks, and foot holding low
room under the gunwales; and the tubes
are less .subject to damage from floating
debris, ice or the caustic effect of oil and
chemical spills.
Although introduced as a 24ft model,
Ram boats range from 21 to 28 feet in
length and can be powered by outboards.
stern drives in both gas and diesel
configuration arid single outboards. The
latter should have a 30 inch shaft length
as this will keep the motor's powerliead
well above the waterline when the boat is
operated at displacement speeds, such as
during lowing. When dual outboards are
selected. 25 inch shaft lengths are
recommended.
Engine comparlmenls. sized for the
largest V-8 gas engine and the longesl
six-cylinder diesel, are sealed so thai
oily water cannot leak into the forward
sections or into the foam flanking the
engine compartment. A welded
coaming surrounds the engine opening
to prevent cockpit water from entering.
With twin 15()hp outboard engines, the
Ram is able to attain speeds of over
45mph and can plane up to 30inph on
a single engine.
A number of interior arrangement are
available, with a standard centre console
an ideal option that maximises working
space, both fore and aft. Where additional
weather protection is required, a pilot
house version provides 360 degree
gunwale access and year-round protection
from wind blast. Features comprise a front
windshield of safety glass liiat opens for

replaced two elderly, single screw vessels
in the task of lowing barges of
containerised refuse away from transfer
stations in central London to sites on the
lower reaches of the river.
Designed by Marine Data

area, developed by Cory for use in
earlier, modernised lutis.
The entire sup erst rue lure and
upperworks comply with a specified
maximum air draft of 4.3m and a well
gla/.ed whcelhouse is located above a

SCOTIA: multi-role fisheries
research ship
In March 1998 the Agriculture,
Environment and Fisheries Department
of the Scottish Office accepted a new
flagship fishery research vessel, (he fourth
of iis type to bear the name Scotia. Built
at a cost of £21 million, the vessel has
mulli-role capabilities suited to worldwide
service and an impressive list of innovative
fen in res.
Built by Ferguson Shipbuilders of Port
Glasgow and designed by Norwegian naval
architects. Skipsleknisk A/S as a
hydrographic research ship. Scotia is also
well equipped as a fully operational pelagic
and demersal trawler. Additional tasks
such as plankton sampling, lowed body
operations. ROV deployment and acoustic
research are well within its capabilities.
Notable features include a retractable
keel unit housing an array of acoustic
transducers for echosounding and
measuring ocean currents, fibre-optic
connections linking a broad range of
sensors and a system of containerised
laboratories which can be outfitted on shore
before loading on board. Special attention
has been paid to the reduction of noise and
vibration to avoid disturbing scientific
equipment.
Propulsion is by means of a iliesel
electric syslcm comprising three WjirLsila
9L20/Ansaldo alternator sets, arranged
amidships. Each unit produce l,485kW
(l,750kVA) at 1JXX) rev/min and feeds a

Considered to be amongst the most
radical aspects of the ship is the principal
containerised laboratory store in which four
20ft wet/dry laboratories are located.
Positioned in the centre section of the main
deck, the laboratories can be adapted and
equipped on shore and loaded in a
combination that is tailored to each voyage,
hull services are provided to each
laboratory when In position by an umbilical
